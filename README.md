PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
	CSGO StaTrak is a stat tracker for CSGO, a popular competitive FPS Shooter game where tracking stats 
  is useful to observing general growth and performance of one's game. The application retrieves public
  data statistics on a given player through the use of Steam's API and processes them to formulate reports
  such as lifetime amount of kills, deaths, and assists or performance percentiles based on the players
  found within the database. The database is handled through the use of SQL with methods of displaying reports
  being done through running queries in the database.
